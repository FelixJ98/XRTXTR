# XRTXTR
This prototype is an experiment in XR using stable diffusion as a quick way to generate a solid texture for a 3D model within the native system. It has potential to create unique assets for future XR and AI experiences with meta quest.
Users can physically grab objects in their space and see their voice commands transform materials in real-time, creating a natural creative workflow that feels like magic.
